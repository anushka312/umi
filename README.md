# 🌱 VerdeFi — Play with Purpose. Give by Playing.

VerdeFi is a purpose-driven Web3 app built on the **Umi Devnet**, where users unlock a calming game experience by making a one-time payment. A large portion of that payment is routed to a donation address — letting users contribute to meaningful causes simply by playing.

> Built for the [Umi Hackathon 2025]

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**  
   Users connect via **Rabby Wallet** (required by Umi Devnet).

2. **Pay to Play**  
   A one-time ETH-based payment unlocks game access.

3. **Donation-Powered Access**  
   Most of the payment is automatically routed to a donation wallet.

4. **Play the Game: Fishies**  
   A peaceful browser game where players collect good fish and avoid bad ones. Over time, bad fish accumulate — increasing the challenge.

5. **Track Your Impact**  
   Users can view their payment history and access status via a personal dashboard tied to their wallet.

## 🐟 The Game: Fishies

A relaxing yet subtly challenging game built with **Phaser.js**.  
- ✅ Collect correct fish to score points  
- ❌ Avoid wrong fish — they stay on screen and block movement  
- 🎯 No timer, no leaderboard — just a cozy, escalating challenge
